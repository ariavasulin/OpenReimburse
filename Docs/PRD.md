4. Technical Specifications 4.1. Frontend: React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS. 4.2. Backend: Supabase. 4.3. Deployment: Vercel. 4.4. Authentication:

Employee App: Twilio (SMS OTP).
Accounting Dashboard: Microsoft OAuth.
4.5. Integrations:

Google Cloud Vision API (for OCR).
Supabase Storage (for receipt image storage, using a bucket named `receipt-images`).
(Consider email service for future admin notifications or password resets if OTP fails).
5. Data Management 5.1. Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL). Receipt metadata (date, amount, category, description, status, employee ID, path to image in Supabase Storage). 5.2. OCR Data Flow: Image upload -> Google Cloud Vision API -> Parsed data pre-fills app fields. 5.3. Image Storage: Original receipt images stored in the Supabase Storage bucket `receipt-images`, with their paths linked in the database. 5.4. Data Retention:

Receipt images in Supabase Storage (`receipt-images` bucket): Stored permanently.
Receipt metadata in Supabase DB: Retained for a minimum of 7 years (for active querying and legal compliance), with potential for archival beyond that.
6. Design & UX Considerations 6.1. Mobile-first responsive design for the employee web app. 
6.2. Clear, intuitive interfaces for both employee and accounting users (referencing provided screenshots as a style guide). 
6.3. Efficient workflows for common tasks (receipt submission, batch review). 
6.4. Clear visual indicators for receipt statuses.
7. Non-Functional Requirements 7.1. Performance:

Page load times: < 3 seconds.
OCR processing time: < 10 seconds per receipt.
7.2. Security:

Adherence to standard web security best practices (OWASP Top 10).
Secure handling of PII and financial data.
Secure API key management for external services (Google Cloud Vision, Twilio, Supabase Storage).
7.3. Scalability: System should be able to handle growth in the number of employees and receipts. 7.4. Reliability: High availability for both employee app and accounting dashboard.
8. Success Metrics (V1) 
8.1. Adoption rate by employees. 
8.2. Reduction in time spent by accounting on receipt processing and management. 
8.3. User satisfaction (measured via feedback from both employees and accountants). 
8.4. Accuracy of OCR data extraction (percentage of fields correctly auto-filled, minimizing accountant edits).
9. Out of Scope for V1 (Future Considerations) 
9.1. Employee Notifications: Email or SMS notifications to employees upon receipt status changes (Approved, Rejected). Decision: Postpone for V1, evaluate need based on usage.
9.2. Advanced in-app reporting and analytics beyond CSV export. 
9.4. Manager approval workflows or distinct user roles beyond Employee and Accountant/Admin.
9.5. Direct integration with accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero). 
9.6. Budget tracking or Job Code specific expense allocation. 
9.7. Detailed audit logs for all changes made by accountants (though Supabase may offer some inherent logging).
